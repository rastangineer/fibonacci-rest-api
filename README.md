# Fibonacci REST API

The Fibonacci REST API has only one single feature:

* Given a `n` index, the API will reply with the value of the `n` position of the Fibonacci series. Example: if `n=3` response should be `2`, if `n=6` response should be `8`.

## Objective

This repository will be used to versioning the code of the solution but also as a journal or notebook about the process followed to implement the solution.

## Initial challenges

* I don't consider myself a `REST API` developer, or even a developer.
* What programming language to use?
* Im familiar with `REST API` services, `SOAP/HTML` Web Services and similar technologies, but should I start with design or just start googling and try?
* How do I start with something basic?
* Thought process?
* Technical decisions?
* Optimizations
